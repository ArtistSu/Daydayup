# Sorting

**Bubble sort**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

**Insertion sort preferable**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity O(1)
- When the input is small (< 15 elements)
- When the input is very close to being sorted

**Selection Sort**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)

**Heap sort**

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Heap sort is a direct optimization of selection sort.

# Binary Search

Useful scenarios:
- Find a figure exists in a sorted array or not
- Find the leftmost position which value>= specific value in a sorted value
    i.e. 122223333444555, try to find the leftmost position of figure which value >=3
- Local Minimum Problem
