# Sorting
**Bubble sort**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

**Insertion sort preferable**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- When the input is small (< 15 elements)
- When the input is very close to being sorted

**Selection Sort**

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

**Heap sort**

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Heap sort is a direct optimization of selection sort.
