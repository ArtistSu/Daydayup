# When we use abstract class and when we use trait

1. Base on primary and secondary relationship you should use a abstract class.
If there is a extra function, you can use trait.
2. Prefer traits. It is convenient for a class to extend multiple traits, but it can only extend one abstract class.
3. If you need to use constructors, you should use a abstract class. Otherwise you should use trait
